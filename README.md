## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the upkeep and development of the website by making Pull Requests or raising Issues.

## Development

We use [Astro](https://astro.build) to build the website. The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). The site uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Astro provides our templating, meaning we can create and reuse components across the site without duplicating code.

To add a new page, create a new `.astro` file in the `src/pages` directory. To add a new component, create a new `.astro` file in the `src/components` directory. Most pages use the `defaultLayout.astro` component to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Writing

> [!CAUTION]
> TODO

The website uses Markdown for content pages. To add a new page, create a new `.md` file in the `src/content` directory, using the `temnplate.md` file as a guide.

You do not need to know how to program to write content, simply use basic Markdown syntax to format your text.

## Setup

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended you work in VSCode with the Astro extension installed.

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 19 or higher, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development Server

To start the development server on `http://localhost:4321`, run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

The website is deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) on push to the `main` branch. Pages uses the `npm run build` command to build the site.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ siteImage.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ siteComponent.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pageLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- `public/` contains static files like images and favicons.
- `src/` contains all the source code for the website.
  - `components/` contains reusable components.
  - `layouts/` contains layout components.
  - `pages/` contains the pages of the website.
