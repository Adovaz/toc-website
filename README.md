## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the upkeep and development of the website by making Pull Requests or raising Issues.

## Writing

[TODO]

The website uses Markdown for content pages. To add a new page, create a new `.md` file in the `src/content` directory, using the `template.md` file as a guide.

You do not need to know how to program to write content, simply use basic Markdown syntax to format your text.

## Development

We use [Astro](https://astro.build) to build the website. The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). The site uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Astro provides our templating, meaning we can create and reuse components across the site without duplicating code.

To add a new page, create a new `.astro` file in the `src/pages` directory. To add a new component, create a new `.astro` file in the `src/components` directory. Most pages use the `defaultLayout.astro` component to maintain a consistent look and feel.

### Setup

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended you work in VSCode with the Astro extension installed.

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 19 or higher, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server on `http://localhost:4321`, run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### ðŸ§ž Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
