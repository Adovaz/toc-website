Markdown is a basic way to write content, without needing to know how to program. It is a simple way to format text.

## How to write markdown

Markdown uses a simple syntax to format text. Here are some examples:

- **Bold text** is written with two asterisks: `**Bold text**`, *Italic text* is written with one asterisk: `*Italic text*`
- Headings are written with a `#` symbol: `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`
- Lists are written with a `-` symbol: `- List item 1`, `- List item 2`
- Links are written with square brackets and parentheses: `[Link text](https://example.com)`
- Images are written with an exclamation mark, square brackets, and parentheses: `![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)`
- Quotes are written with a `>` symbol: `> Quote text`

For more information on markdown syntax, you can refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## How to add a new page

To add a new page, create a new `.md` file in the `src/pages/resources` directory. You can use this file as a template to get started.

Setting the title, publication date, description, image, and tags at the top of the file lets the website know how to display the page.
