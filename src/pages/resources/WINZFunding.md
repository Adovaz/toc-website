You can get hair removal and voice training funded through work and income's disability allowance. Just follow the steps below. 

## Get Quotes
Call voice training and/or hair removal places for quotes. Ask for each session's cost as well as how many are needed and how frequently. This can be an email or an official quote. 

## Fill in the Form
Go to the WINZ Website and sign up for a MYMSD account and client number, this is a fairly simple process, add your preferred name and they’ll use it for pretty much everything.

Print off the Extra Help Form from the WINZ website here: [https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/documents/forms/extra-help-application.pdf](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/documents/forms/extra-help-application.pdf)
You can put your preferred name in the first section, then the legal name below it. 

### Health Practitioner Letter of Support
Fill out the form as best you can, the section of interest is the disability benefit section, get a health practitioner to complete their section of the form, also ask for a letter for support from them explaining what gender dysphoria is that hair and voice contributes to it, and why shaving is not an option. Should look like this: 

> Dear MSD,
> This letter is in support of _____ being supported in accessing essential medical treatment to address their gender dysphoria secondary to hirsutism and previous masculinising puberty resulting in unwanted voice changes, _____ experiences significant gender dysphoria in relation to both the presence of facial hair and the act of shaving. To address this I request that you support them by funding laser hair removal and/or electrolysis, _____ and experiences significant gender dysphoria in relation to their voice as a result of previously undergoing masculinising puberty. Funding for voice training therapy with a speech therapist would be greatly appreciated in addressing this. These issues impact _____ on a daily basis and negatively contribute to ongoing gender dysphoria and social anxiety, impacting them during work and study.
> Thanks,
