- Live and Let Dye, 3/476 Mt Eden Road came very highly recommended, and is reasonably priced.

- At the top end price wise is Vada Salon, 59 Pitt Street, CBD. (Vada Salon were the people who did Queer Cuts, which offered free salon cuts to queer and gender diverse rangatahi for Pride)
- Also, Seville’s Academy, 8 Canada Street, CBD, is the training salon, so people get salon cuts at very reasonable prices when they are training students.
- I’m not a Barber; 45 New North Road, Eden Terrace has a rainbow friendly rating.
- Any hairdresser / hair salon on K Road will be rainbow friendly.
- Hue, which has a range of salons across Auckland, is also pretty good.
- Synergy Hair (NZ), Westfield St Lukes – trans friendly
- Blu Hair Design 2/709 Swanson Road, Swanson. Trans and budget friendly
- Kafune 119 Onehunga Mall (Natasha and Lou recommended as the stylists)
- Vivo in the Chancery. <https://vivo.co.nz> A bit on the expensive side, but many community recommendations.
- Flash City Barbers, 125A Ponsonby Road. They do all kinds of cuts on all lengths of hair, not just masculine cuts. They cater to feminine people as well. Have a non-binary barber, but they are all super nice. Cash only, have an online booking system: <https://flashcity.schedulista.com/>
- Boudoir Beauty, Level 2,221 K’Rd. (Ashley recommended as the stylist)
- Howlin’ Wolf Cuts & Coffee in the city are ‘awesome’
- Electric Ceremony, 19/3 Khyber Pass Road. Ask for Sez- non-binary barber and drag king. Comes highly recommended. <https://spookyceremony1.schedulista.com/>
